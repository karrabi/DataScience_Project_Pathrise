## Introduction

The **DataScience_Project_Pathrise** assesses the ability to analyze and predict fellows' outcomes within the Pathrise program. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, building predictive models, and translating results into actionable recommendations for the company.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following stages:

1. **pathrise-Preprocessing.ipynb**: This notebook contains the initial data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

2. **pathrise-EDA.ipynb**: The exploratory data analysis notebook explores data patterns, distributions, and relationships, providing insights that inform the modeling process.

3. **pathrise-ModelingPipeline.ipynb**: This notebook outlines the development of a predictive modeling pipeline. It includes feature selection, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To explore the Pathrise Data Challenge project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/karrabi/DataScience_Project_Pathrise.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd PathriseDataChallenge
```

3. Review the notebooks in each stage to understand the analysis process.

## Usage

The project notebooks can be used as a guide to:

- Understand the data preprocessing steps necessary for analysis.
- Explore data patterns and relationships through EDA.
- Develop a modeling pipeline for predictive analysis.

Feel free to modify the code and analysis techniques according to your insights.

## Results and Presentation

The final results and recommendations are documented in the `pathrise_presentation.pptx` presentation file. This presentation summarizes the findings, insights, and actionable suggestions based on the analysis.

## Contributing

Contributions are not expected for this project, as it's part of an assessment. However, if you discover any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or provide feedback.
